This is the documentation of ineqbench's restapi-backend.

This software was designed to provide REST API interfaces to ineqbench's backend system. 
Queries are to be made with a single page application from a web browser, or any other HTTP REST client, such as a mobile application. 

The application currently contains a sample Customer class and relevant methods. 
 - GET /getCustomerById?id=4
	returns customer number 4 from CUSTOMER

 - GET /getCustomerByName?name=someone 
	returns an array of customers matching the name 'someone' from CUSTOMER

 - POST /addCustomer?name=someone&age=21 
	adds a 21 years old customer called 'someone' to database's CUSTOMER 

 - DELETE /deleteCustomer?id=4
	deletes customer number 4 from the table CUSTOMER 

Prerequisites: 
	 - Java 8
	 - Maven
	 - MySQL 

To setup and enter MySQL details edit src/main/resources/database/Spring-Datasource.xml 

I used `mvn spring-boot:run` on MacOS 10.11 to compile and run the application.
